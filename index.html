                            Do your best to keep it clean

                        <p>
                            Sweeping or blowing away leaves and other debris regularly will help prolong the life of your asphalt. This debris will cause your asphalt to deteriorate faster, but it can also lead to staining and other unsightly blemishes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another essential thing to remember is never to power wash your asphalt. Power washing can remove the top layer of asphalt, which will leave your pavement susceptible to further damage. If you must power wash, use a low-pressure setting and hold the wand at least 12 inches away from your asphalt surface.
                        </p>

                        If you have any trees on your property, it’s important to trim back any overhanging branches. This will protect your asphalt from damage caused by falling limbs or leaves. It’s also a good idea to seal your asphalt every few years. This will help protect it from the elements and prevent it from deteriorating prematurely.

                    Be mindful of the chemicals you use
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chemicals like salt and oil can do severe damage to your asphalt. Try to use environmentally friendly products that won’t harm your property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most important things you can do to maintain your asphalt is to keep it clean. Remove any spills or stains as soon as possible, and sweep or hose off any dirt or debris. A power washer can be used on tougher stains, but be careful not to damage the asphalt with too much pressure.
                </p>

                    Don’t wait to get it repaired if you notice any cracks or other damage to your asphalt. Minor problems can quickly turn into big ones, so it’s always best to take care of them right away. There are various products available that can be used to repair the damage, so talk to a professional about what would be best for your specific situation.

                    Ignoring small cracks and holes in your asphalt will only make them worse. Filling them in as soon as you notice them will help prevent further damage and make your asphalt look better in the meantime. You don’t need to hire a professional to do this – all you need is some <a href="http://asphaltolympiawa.com/asphalt-repair-olympia/">asphalt repair</a> mastic and a putty knife.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, use the putty knife to clean out any dirt or debris from the <a href="http://asphaltolympiawa.com/crack-sealing-olympia/">crack or hole</a>. Next, apply the asphalt repair mastic to the area, using the putty knife to spread it evenly. Be sure to fill in the room completely, up to the level of the surrounding asphalt. Finally, use a tamper or other heavy object to compact the mastic and ensure it bonds well with the surrounding asphalt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simple repair will help prolong the life of your asphalt and keep it looking its best. Don’t wait until small cracks turn into big problems – take care of them right away!
